  - Added a wait when checking for randoms. This will hopefully stop      
    the lag some people are experienced.

  - Made walking faster. There isn't such a long wait before cutting the

    a normal tree as much.

Rev. 59:
  - Adjusted banking a little; it shouldn't take as long to close the bank and start walking
